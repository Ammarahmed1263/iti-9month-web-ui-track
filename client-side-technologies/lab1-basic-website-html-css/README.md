## Task Description
Build a simple multi-page website applying core HTML and CSS concepts.

The website must include **three pages**:

- Clicking the image redirects to the **Main Page**
- *(Extended in Lab 2)*:
  - Auto-redirect to registration page after 5 seconds
  - Clicking "enter" image redirects to login page

### 2) Main Page
Use the following HTML features:
- Headings (`h1` to `h6`)
- Text formatting styles (bold, underline, italic, colored text, etc.)
- Lists (ordered or unordered)
- A link that jumps to the top of the page

### 3) Contact Us Page
- The top image must work as an **image map** (each defined area opens a related website in a new tab/window)
- The bottom image should be clickable to **send an email** to the site owner
- Include copyright text at the bottom of the page

### General Requirements
- Use images wherever needed
- Apply styles using **one external CSS file** shared across all pages
